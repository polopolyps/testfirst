testfirst
=========

The testfirst tool is a test framework for testing polopoly projects. 

Testfirst should be considered legacy at this point and if you are using Polopoly version 10.6 or higher you should instead 
be using Testbase which is available here on http://www.github.com/polopolyps/testbase
